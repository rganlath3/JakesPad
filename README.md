# JakesPad
A custom built fighting gamepad controller for arcade style games. This controller is custom sized for "Jake". It uses a raspberry pi 2040 chipset along with Kailh keyswitches with a custom 3D printed enclosure and PCB.
This is based on jfedor2's flatbox rev5 design. I reverse engineered the PCB from his design here: https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox.git
